# What is Lution?

Lution is a third-party app that upgrades your Sober experience with quality-of-life tweaks and extra features. It‚Äôs kind of like [Lucem](https://github.com/xTrayambak/lucem) or [Bloxstrap](https://github.com/bloxstraplabs/bloxstrap), but built entirely in **Python** .

Oh, and yes ‚Äî **it works with Bloxstrap mods too!!111**

<sub>If your mods aren't working, drop an issue on GitHub so we can take a look (might be our bad tbh)</sub>
