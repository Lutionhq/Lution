# What is Lution?

Lution is a third-party application designed to enhance your experience with Sober by providing quality-of-life improvements and additional features. Similar to other bootstrappers like [Lucem](https://github.com/xTrayambak/lucem) and [Bloxstrap](https://github.com/bloxstraplabs/bloxstrap), Lution stands out because it's built entirely with **Python**.

And yes **This app can work with bloxstrap mods!!!11** 

<sub>If your bloxstrap mods not working please report your mods into the github issues page so we can know (Our fault)</sub>

# Get Started (Install or Contribute)

Ready to try Lution or contribute to its development? Follow these simple steps:

### 1\. Get Python

Make sure you have **Python** installed on your system.

### 2\. Clone the Project

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/triisdang/Lution.git
cd Lution
```

### 3\. Create a New Environment

It's good practice to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate 
```

### 4\. Install Requirements

Install all necessary packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5\. Run Lution


```bash
cd src/strapter
python3 streamlit run main.py
```
